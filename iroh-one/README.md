# Iroh One

Single binary of [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) services
([gateway](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-gateway),
[p2p](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-p2p),
[store](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-store))
communicating via mem channels. This is an alternative to deploying the iroh
services as micro services.
