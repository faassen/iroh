# We want to compile `iroh-ctl` in test mode, but we can't specify that yet:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1982
# This is a workaround for enabling features only during testing: 
# https://github.com/DesmondWillowbrook/cargo-optional-features-for-testing-and-examples
# It is needed to have trycmd invoke a version of the iroh CLI in testing
# mode. trycmd needs to have an actual binary to invoke.
# Unfortunately this also turns on the feature during development, which may be
# confusing. See the comments in `run.rs` surrounding this.
